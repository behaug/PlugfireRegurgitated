# Plugfire Regurgitated

Retro demo coded and [released](ftp://ftp.gathering.org/TG/2017/CreativeCompos/Demo/Plugfire_Regurgitated_by_FOAM.zip) at TG17 by FOAM.

This is a quick and dirty remake of the original [Plugfire 64k intro](ftp://ftp.gathering.org/TG/1996/PC64k/TG96_PC_64K_Foam_Plugfire.mpg) released by FOAM on TG96. It is using the track [Tarmkrampe](ftp://ftp.gathering.org/TG/1998/Fastmod/TRACK08.mp3) from FOAM's Fast Music entry from TG98.

This is code was thrown together in a haste the night before the compo with all DirectX boilerplate code taken straight off the internet. All relevant demo code is in Plugfire.cs.
